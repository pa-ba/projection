Projection
==========

This package implements a projection function for arbitrarily nested
binary product types. The implementation is based on closed type
families and follows the approach described in the paper
[*Composing and Decomposing Data Types*](http://www.diku.dk/~paba/modularity/pubs/entries/bahr14wgp.html)
(Workshop on Generic Programming, 2014, to appear).
