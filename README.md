Projection
==========

This package implements a projection function for arbitrarily nested
binary product types. The implementation is based on closed type
families and follows the approach described in the paper
[*Composing and Decomposing Data Types*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2633628.2633635)
(Workshop on Generic Programming, 2014).
